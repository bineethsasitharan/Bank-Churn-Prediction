# Bank-Churn-Prediction
Using Decision Tree &amp; Random Forest Classification Algorithms

ðŸ’»In this project, we focused on bank churn prediction using two classification algorithms: Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest ClassifierðŸ¤–.

ðŸ’¡ðŸ“ˆTo optimize the performance of these models, we used hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search CV. This technique systematically searches for the optimal combination of hyperparameters, such as maximum depth, minimum sample split, and number of estimators to improve model performanceðŸ“š.

ðŸŒŸðŸš€After hyperparameter tuning, we evaluated the performance of the models using various classification metrics. These metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These measures provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify churned and non-churned bank customersðŸŽ¯.

ðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰Additionally, we utilized the AUC-ROC (Area Under the Curve - Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve to evaluate the overall performance of the models. The AUC-ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate and provides an aggregate measure of the model's predictive power. A higher AUC-ROC score indicates better discrimination and prediction capabilitiesðŸ”¬ðŸ“Š.
